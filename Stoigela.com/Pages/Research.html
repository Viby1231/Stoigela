        <h1>GENERAL BACKGROUND</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The following institutions tested the Zoilevium range of products for safety:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Onderstepoort Biological Products SOC Ltd. No adverse findings were reported.</li>
                <li>IDEXX Laboratories. No adverse findings were reported.</li>
                <li>Bureau Veritas. Products adhere to SANS241 standard for healthy potable water.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="institution-images">
            <img src="../../Images/Onderstepoort.png">
            <img src="../../Images/IDEXX.png">
            <img src="../../Images/Bureau.png">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>General well-being implies a situation where one is generally “not sick”. The human body does however
                seem to be a target-rich environment for attacks from sources, foreign and/or domestic, so to speak.
                Bacteria, viruses, pathogens, cancers, autoimmune diseases, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia, and many
                other “enemies” are constantly looking for ways to attack our bodies. Our only natural defence against
                these attacks is our immune system. The immune system performs a vital role in protecting our bodies
                from harmful substances, like germs and cell changes that could make you ill. Without an immune system,
                we would have no way of fighting harmful pathogens that enter our bodies from the outside or harmful
                changes that occur inside our bodies.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Main Tasks of the Immune System</h2>
            <p>The main tasks of the body’s immune system are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to fight disease-causing pathogens like bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi,</li>
                <li>to recognize and neutralize harmful substances from the environment, and</li>
                <li>to fight disease-causing changes in the body, such as cancer cells.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The Covid-19 outbreak was so widespread and devastating that it highlighted how vulnerable we are to
                attacks from such pathogens. To make things worse, the new generation of pathogens (for our purposes
                specifically bacteria and viruses), are becoming more and more resistant to conventional medicines and
                antibiotics. This is becoming so prevalent that these pathogens have earned the nickname of super-bugs.
                This drug resistance is referred to as antimicrobial resistance or AMR.</p>
            <p>Where Covid-19 is estimated to have claimed close to 7 million lives to date (February 2024), AMR claimed
                around 5 million lives in 2019 alone and is projected to potentially claim up to 10 million lives
                annually by 2050, and this figure is already starting to look low. Joshi says that, next to climate
                change, AMR is the most urgent global healthcare challenge the human species is facing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>So why is the discussion about AMR and immune systems important? Well, because one factor jeopardising
                our general well-being is the impact of AMR on our health. Case in point being Covid-19 or stubborn
                infections that just won’t respond to antibiotics. A second factor in our general well-being is the
                resilience of our immune systems. The stronger our immune systems are, the better they can protect us
                against constant attacks from harmful pathogens.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>This dual risk factor reasoning prompted the development of the Zoilevium product range. The approach was
                based on the following logic:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the immune system can be boosted, it will be beneficial to our general well-being, and</li>
                <li>If tenacious, drug-resistant pathogens can be combatted, general well-being can be improved.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>A range of 3 Zoilevium products were developed to speak to these 2 problem areas (immune support and AMR
                support). All Zoilevium products are mineral-based products. All amounts of minerals in the products are
                below accepted recommended dietary allowances (RDAs). The products have also been tested against the
                SANS 241 standard for safe potable water, and have been found to be within the prescribed allowable
                ranges. But why go the minerals route to address the 2 problem areas, one might ask?</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The value of minerals to the body is well-known and not disputed. Minerals are not required in great
                amounts in our bodies, yet play very significant biological roles and are essential for life. Minerals
                and Vitamins, also called micronutrients, are the building blocks for good health. They are critical for
                several important bodily functions. They support and improve numerous coenzymes and cofactors and play a
                vital role in the processes of energy production. People who do not have enough of these essential
                nutrients develop micronutrient malnutrition, which can have devastating consequences. Micronutrients
                are vital to healthy development, disease prevention, and well-being.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The products’ efficacy relies on the following inherent and undisputed properties of the minerals used in
                our products:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Their natural antimicrobial properties which may help the body combat unwanted infections.</li>
                <li>Their natural contribution to improvement and support of the body’s immune system.</li>
                <li>Their natural innate contributions to the body’s normal functioning and overall general well-being.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>There is sound academic and scientific research and evidence to substantiate the confidence we have in
                the value that our products may be able to add as an augmentation to a normal medical treatment regime
                and/or daily supplement, as well as for the contribution our products may be able to make in assisting
                the body in dealing with the improvement of general well-being. As such, our products are to be viewed
                and used as supplements to assist with areas of well-being they have been designed for.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>We believe that our formulations, combinations, and processes in producing our products are unique and
                the basis of the confidence in our products we espouse. One example is the boom around the use of a Zinc
                supplement to general health. The facts are however that just using a Zinc supplement may lead to a
                Copper deficiency. Similarly, a too high intake of Copper (through supplementation or via normal dietary
                intake) can cause a Zinc deficiency. Both deficiencies have their own negative impact on the body and
                general health. Scientific literature suggests that it is important to strike an optimally balanced
                ratio between Zinc and Copper intake. Copper and Zinc work together in processes such as immune
                response, nervous system function, and healthy digestion. They are, however, antagonists, meaning that
                as levels of one decreases, the levels of the other increases and vice versa. Because this is an
                important factor in Copper and Zinc supplementation, we have used the most optimal ratio in the
                formulation of our products to pre-empt this antagonistic relationship.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The Zoilevium product range has been divided into 2 categories, namely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Products with the main functionality being to improve the body’s response to AMR, and</li>
                <li>Products with the main functionality being to boost</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The 2 categories will now be discussed in greater detail.</p>

            <h2>1. CATEGORY 1 – PRODUCTS COMBATTING AMR</h2>
            <p>Mineral/Metal-based drugs are inorganic compounds that have been used in medicinal chemistry as
                therapeutic agents for a long time. It is now common knowledge that a variety of metal ions are toxic to
                bacteria and can therefore act as an antibacterial agent. These metal complexes have been successfully
                used as anticancer treatments, anti-inflammatories, antidiabetic drugs, antimicrobial agents and in the
                treating of specific conditions, such as Diabetes Mellitus, Huntington’s disease, Atherosclerosis and
                Wilson’s disease, among others.</p>

            <p>Metal-based compounds have also proven to have remarkable antimicrobial properties and certainly have
                great potential in the prospective development of a new response to AMR. Evans and Kavanagh published a
                paper in which they investigated the use of metals as antibacterial agents. According to them,
                metal-based antibacterial compounds have novel modes of action that may provide an advantage in the
                treatment of bacterial infections with resistance to conventional antibiotics. Metal-based compounds are
                rapidly emerging as an alternative to organic drugs, as they have the ability to kill pathogens via
                metal-specific modes of action. This field of research is developing metal complexes with remarkable
                actions, and new metal-based drugs are emerging every year.</p>

            <p>An advantage to the use of metal-based antimicrobial approaches is their diverse modes of action compared
                to conventional organic antibiotics. Therefore, the use of these metal-based complexes alone or in
                combination with antibiotics, holds promise as an effective treatment against resistant bacterial
                infections through these novel and additional modes of action.</p>

            <p>Some of these novel modes of action include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ability to disrupt the protective layers of certain microorganisms and thus interfering with
                    their vital processes.</li>
                <li>The ability to disrupt bacterial cell membranes, damaging the DNA or RNA of the microbe.</li>
                <li>The ability to generate ferociously reactive oxidative stress on bacterial cells, which can kill
                    bacteria.</li>
                <li>The ability to interfere with critical proteins that operate important functions that keep bacterial
                    cells alive.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Various minerals in Zoilevium are well known for their antimicrobial properties, therefore the Zoilevium
                products can be described as mineral-based antimicrobial compounds that are produced by bioinorganic
                chemistry, and which exhibit the characteristics and modes of action of a broad spectrum, inorganic,
                metallo-antibiotic.</p>

            <p>The efficacy as antimicrobial agents of our mineral-based products can be seen in the results of the
                following laboratory test results:</p>
            <img class="table" src="../../Images/Bacteria Table.png">
            <p>All tests were done by AMBIO Environmental Management (Pty) Ltd, a division of the Vaal University of
                Technology (VUT), an INDEPENDENT and ACCREDITED laboratory. The Lab tests were done to test the efficacy
                of Zoilevium as an antimicrobial agent.</p>
            <div class="environmental-management-image">
                <img src="../../Images/Sanas.png">
            </div>
            <p>The chart shows how various types of bacteria were incubated until 10,000+ or 100,000+ colonies were
                present. These colonies of bacteria were then treated with our AMR-based formula. The results after 24
                hours show that all bacteria colonies had been totally eradicated. The only sample where there was a
                minute number of bacteria left, was a blend of 8 different types of bacteria incubated in the same petri
                dish.</p>

            <p>The advantage of such an effective antimicrobial supplement is that one’s immune system now has a
                powerful partner to rely on when combatting unwanted pathogens. This frees up the immune system to get
                back to basics and focus on keeping the body in a state of general well-being.</p>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>Metal-based antimicrobial complexes have several advantages over conventional antibiotics in that they
                have multiple and novel modes of action.</p>

            <p>Scientific literature is proliferated with research supporting the potential of metal-based antimicrobial
                efficacy in the battle against AMR and the prospective advantages that these metal-based compounds may
                add to the medical field (see bibliography).</p>

            <p>The reality is that the use of metal-based products as an antimicrobial is not new science, it is only
                forgotten science. Our products use the inherent properties of minerals to increase your body’s immune
                system, while also assisting in killing unwanted and unwelcome intruders thereby alleviating the immune
                system's workload.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this information brief is to give all users of our supplements the confidence and peace of
                mind that they will be using a product that has been developed with generally accepted scientific and
                academic views, principles, and methodologies as foundation. (For further in-depth discussions and

            <h2>1.1 ZOILEVIUM PUREGUT</h2>
            <img class="product" src="../../Images/Zoilevium PureGut Logo.jpg">
            <h3>IBS, IBD, Crohn’s & Overall Gut Health Support</h3>
            <p>Zoilevium PureGut is a mineral-based antimicrobial compound that has the properties and modes of action
                of a broad spectrum, inorganic, metallo-antibiotic.</p>

            <p>According to the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel
                disease (IBD with main types being Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis) are two distinct
                gastrointestinal disorders. The Mayo Clinic describes Crohn's disease as a type of IBD which causes
                swelling of the tissues (inflammation) in the digestive tract. This can lead to abdominal pain, severe
                diarrhoea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can involve
                different areas of the digestive tract in different people.</p>

            <p>The most debilitating thing about Crohn’s disease is that it is believed that there is no known cure. The
                National Health Service (NHS) in Great Britain describes Crohn's disease as a “lifelong condition”. The
                best that the medical fraternity can do is to try and reduce the symptoms and hope for periods of
                remission where patients can try and lead a semi-normal life.</p>

            <h3>The Zoilevium PureGut IBD & IBS Support explained in 3-steps.</h3>

            <h4>Step 1: What causes Crohn’s disease?</h4>
            <p>To understand how Zoilevium PureGut can assist with IBD and IBS-related issues, we first need to try and
                figure out what causes Crohn’s disease. It turns out that nobody really knows. The best anyone can do is
                speculate. Typical answers you might find when researching the subject are: “The exact cause of Crohn's
                disease remains unknown.” “Doctors aren’t sure what causes Crohn's disease.” and, “There’s no known
                cause of Crohn’s disease.”</p>

            <p>It is extremely difficult to treat something you don’t know the cause of. How do you treat “something” if
                you don’t know what that “something” is? The best one can then do is treat the symptoms, because you
                can’t treat what you can’t identify. How do you solve a problem if you don’t know what the problem is?
                This is exactly what is happening with the current treatments of Crohn’s disease. Symptoms are being
                treated to alleviate discomfort, but the problem is never addressed and eradicated.</p>

            <p>Some of the best guesses as to the cause of Crohn’s disease are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A weakened immune system (the body's defence against infection) may lead to bacteria in the
                    digestive tract which may cause the body’s immune system to attack healthy cells in the digestive
                    system (this is called an autoimmune disease). Key take-aways: Bacteria and immune system.</li>
                <li>Heredity. Crohn's disease is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so
                    genes may play a role.</li>
                <li>A previous stomach bug which may open the door for other bacteria which may cause Crohn’s. Key
                    take-away: Bacteria.</li>
                <li>An abnormal balance of gut bacteria. The use of antibiotics may disturb the normal bacterial
                    ecosystem, which in turn may open the door to bad bacteria which may cause Crohn’s. Key take-away:
                    Bacteria.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At closer analysis, it seems that 3 of the 4 potential causes lean towards some or other bacterial
                involvement. Maybe this observation can bring us closer to a tenable answer as to a potential cause to
                be addressed when supporting and complimenting a normal treatment regime.</p>

            <h4>Step 2: A closer look at potential bacterial candidates</h4>
            <p>Based on the information gained in Step 1, let’s take a closer look at some suspicious bacteria that
                might be a source of concern.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP):</strong> MAP is a bacterial parasite that has
                    long been considered to be a potential cause of Crohn's disease. Evidence in support of the
                    hypothesis that MAP is a causative agent for Crohn's disease was reported as far back as the 1980’s.
                    A study performed by Patterson et al (2021) found that there was evidence that MAP is highly
                    associated with Crohn’s disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Clostridioides (clostridium) difficile (c. diff):</strong> C. diff is an anaerobic
                    gram-positive, spore-forming, bacterium that causes intestinal diseases varying from mild diarrhoea
                    to severe colitis. C. diff infection (CDI) is a leading health concern worldwide. C. diff is
                    responsible for 20% - 30% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and 50% - 75% of cases of
                    antibiotic associated colitis. IBD has been found to be associated with C. diff. People most often
                    get C. diff infection after taking antibiotics that killed off other, helpful bacteria. This allows
                    C. diff to spread quickly. C. diff is very hard to kill. They are resistant to heat, acid and many
                    antibiotics and disinfectants. Although it is still not clear whether C. diff is a cause of IBD or a
                    consequence of the inflammatory state in the intestinal environment, it is generally accepted that
                    C. diff is somehow involved in Crohn’s disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Antibiotic and other treatments:</strong> Antibiotic use can have several negative effects
                    on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Antibiotic use may disrupt the normal bacterial ecosystem and
                    thereby trigger new infections such as C. diff.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step 3: Why Zoilevium PureGut may be an effective support system.</h4>
            <p>Zoilevium PureGut has the properties of a broad spectrum, inorganic, metallo-antibiotic. This means that
                it is a mineral-based antimicrobial compound produced by using bioinorganic chemistry.</p>

            <p>The value of minerals to our health is common knowledge and not disputed. Three of the various
                ingredients used in Zoilevium PureGut are magnesium, copper and zinc. These minerals have the following
                attributes that may act in supporting IBD and IBS treatments:</p>

            <h5>Magnesium</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Magnesium is a nutrient that the body needs to stay healthy. Magnesium is important for many
                    processes in the body, including regulating muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood
                    pressure and making protein, bone, and DNA.</li>
                <li>It is a vital mineral that is involved in hundreds of enzyme-related reactions in the human body.
                </li>
                <li>New research confirms the antibacterial properties of magnesium.</li>
                <li>It contributes to normal electrolyte balance.</li>
                <li>It contributes to tissue formation.</li>
                <li>It has a role in the process of cell division.</li>
                <li>It is a factor in the maintenance of good health.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Copper</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Copper is an essential trace element which is involved in numerous biological processes.</li>
                <li>It helps to produce and repair connective tissue.</li>
                <li>It contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress.</li>
                <li>It contributes to the normal function of the immune system.</li>
                <li>It helps to produce and repair connective tissue.</li>
                <li>It helps to form red blood cells.</li>
                <li>It is a factor in the maintenance of good health.</li>
                <li>The anti-inflammatory activity of copper complexes has been known for several decades and has been
                    used to treat inflammatory disorders.</li>
                <li>Copper is a very effective antimicrobial which employs various modes of action to kill pathogens.
                </li>
                <li>Tests show that copper was able to kill Clostridium difficile bacteria in 10 minutes to 2 hours.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Zinc</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Zinc is the 2nd most prevalent vestigial element in the human body, and it is essential for
                    individuals to remain healthy. Since excess Zinc is not stored in the body, it must be consumed
                    regularly as part of a healthy diet.</li>
                <li>It helps in connective tissue formation.</li>
                <li>It contributes to normal acid-base metabolism.</li>
                <li>It contributes to normal DNA synthesis.</li>
                <li>It is a factor in the maintenance of good health.</li>
                <li>It contributes to normal macronutrient metabolism.</li>
                <li>It contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress.</li>
                <li>It has a role in the process of cell division.</li>
                <li>It is critical to the formation of protective epithelial barriers (gut lining).</li>
                <li>It helps your immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses.</li>
                <li>It helps with your body’s anti-inflammatory response.</li>
                <li>Zinc is a very effective antimicrobial which employs various modes of action to kill pathogens.</li>
                <li>Zinc oxide (ZnO) appears to have a strong protective effect in resisting intestinal diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Zoilevium PureGut minerals aid the conventional IBD and IBS treatments in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They help the body maintain a healthy immune system. This helps the body fight off unwanted
                    pathogens, like those causing IBD and IBS.</li>
                <li>They help with tissue formation which helps the healing process of damage to the intestinal linings
                    that are caused by IBD and IBS infections.</li>
                <li>They help with the keeping of general gut health.</li>
                <li>The antimicrobial properties help in killing potential IBD and IBS bacterial causes like
                    Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and Clostridioides (clostridium) difficile and/or other
                    causative bacteria.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is therefore clear that there is academic, scientific and “logically deduced inferences to the best
                explanation” reasons to believe that Zoilevium PureGut may be a valuable add-on to a normal treatment
                regime for IBD and IBS as well as to the general maintenance of a healthy gastrointestinal tract.</p>
            <h2>1.2 ZOILEVIUM TOPICAL</h2>
            <img class="product" src="../../Images/Zoilevium Topical Logo.jpg">
            <h3>General, Topical Antiseptic and Antibacterial Treatment</h3>
            <p>Zoilevium Topical is a mineral-based antimicrobial and disinfectant compound that has the properties and
                modes of action of a broad spectrum, inorganic, metallo-antibiotic.</p>

            <p>The number of effective antibiotics is steadily decreasing, and to the extent that in future there may be
                no antibiotics left that can successfully combat infections. Today, drug-resistant infections are a
                serious threat to people’s (and global) health. If modern medicine wants to continue as a solution to
                infections, the discovery of new antibiotics able to kill drug-resistant bacteria, is essential.</p>

            <h3>What is antimicrobial resistance?</h3>
            <p>Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, and other organisms develop a way to
                prevent antimicrobial drugs (like antibiotics) from effectively killing them or controlling their
                growth. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become
                ineffective, and pathogens do not respond to the drugs designed to kill them. This means that infections
                that used to be treatable can become increasingly difficult or impossible to treat.</p>

            <p>The number of effective antibiotics is steadily decreasing, and to such an extent that in future there
                may be no antibiotics left that can successfully combat infections. The potential scope of the problem
                is so great that the WHO says that without urgent action, the world is heading for a post-antibiotic
                era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, no new classes of antibiotics have been discovered since the 1980s. A class means a type
                of antibiotic that works in a certain way, for example attacking a specific germ function (this is
                called its mode of action). However, due to the prevalence of AMR, the search for new classes of
                antibacterial agents has now spread to the likes of metal ions, nanoparticles, and metal compounds.</p>

            <h3>The future of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) treatment</h3>
            <p>Evans and Kavanagh published a paper in which they investigated the use of metals as antibacterial
                agents. They say that metals have a history of antibacterial uses, but with the discovery of antibiotics
                became overlooked and effectively discarded and ignored. According to them, metal-based antibacterial
                compounds have novel modes of action that may provide an advantage in the treatment of bacterial
                infections with resistance to conventional antibiotics.</p>

            <p>An ideal novel antibacterial compound must be able to combat both the acquired and the intrinsic
                resistance mechanisms of bacteria. Metal-based antibacterial compounds have been proposed as a candidate
                for the development of a novel class of antibiotics for the effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant
                bacteria.</p>

            <h3>Why metal-based antibacterial compounds</h3>
            <p>We’ve known for a long time that various metals are effective in killing microbes and that metals have
                commonly been used for antibacterial purposes. With the rise in AMR and the difficulties in producing
                antibiotics with novel modes of action, research into the use of metal-based pharmaceuticals as
                antimicrobial agents has resurfaced and is gaining popularity.</p>

            <p>An advantage to the use of metal-based antibiotics is their diverse modes of action compared to
                conventional organic antibiotics. Therefore, the use of these metal-based complexes alone or in
                combination with antibiotics holds promise as an effective treatment against resistant microbial
                infections through these novel and additional modes of action.</p>

            <h3>The following minerals are part of the ingredients found in Zoilevium Topical and are well known for
                their antimicrobial properties:</h3>

            <h4>Magnesium</h4>
            <p>Magnesium is a vital mineral that is involved in hundreds of enzyme-related reactions in the human body.
                In the last few years, new research is emerging showing the antibacterial properties of magnesium.</p>
            <p>Recent research has found that Magnesium has the ability to impair bacterial adhesion and formation of
                complex communities of bacterial cells called biofilms. It has been hypothesized that the Magnesium ions
                affect the membranes of bacterial cells causing them to be “leakier”. Studies found that coating
                different surfaces with magnesium or magnesium compounds had the effect of reducing the presence of
                bacteria and biofilm.</p>

            <h4>Copper</h4>
            <p>The antibacterial effect of copper on a wide range of pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses,
                has been demonstrated by many laboratory studies. Furthermore, apart from being an effective
                antimicrobial agent, exposure to copper has been correlated with enhanced wound healing.</p>
            <p>Research has further shown that many disease-causing bacteria such as E. coli, hospital superbugs, and
                several viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) are susceptible to exposure to copper surfaces.</p>

            <h4>How copper kills</h4>
            <p>Research has shown that copper works in several different ways to shut down bacterial cells’ chemistry
                and physiology. Copper, through copper oxide, kills germs through three main pathways, with five total
                modes of action available at any time it comes into contact with cells. Any of these five kill methods
                can destroy bacteria, and overlapping mechanisms can also prevent, or at the very least, make developing
                resistance much more challenging.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It has the ability to disrupt the protective layers of certain microorganisms and interfering with
                    their vital processes.</li>
                <li>It disrupts bacterial cell membranes, damaging the DNA or RNA of the microbe.</li>
                <li>It generates ferociously reactive oxidative stress on bacterial cells and develops hydrogen
                    peroxide, which can kill bacteria cells.</li>
                <li>It interferes with critical proteins that operate important functions that keep bacterial cells
                    alive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Zinc</h4>
            <p>It's long been known that Zinc plays an important role in the body's ability to protect against bacterial
                infection. Researchers have found that Zinc can 'starve' bacteria by preventing its uptake of an
                essential metal, namely Manganese, that bacteria need to be able to invade and cause disease in humans.
                Zinc interferes with a protein transporter in the bacteria so that it cannot absorb Manganese. Without
                Manganese, bacteria can more easily be cleared by the natural immune system.</p>
            <p>There is also sufficient evidence in the literature to indicate that zinc-ions have multiple inhibitory
                effects on bacterial cell activities. A vast number of published studies have used zinc-oxide
                nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent. ZnO-NPs can disturb the bacterial growth either by interacting
                with the bacterial surface or entering inside the bacterial cells leading to the disruption of bacterial
                enzyme systems.</p>
            <p>Zinc-oxide also combats bacterial infection in a non-direct antibacterial way by protecting cells,
                inhibiting bacterial adhesion, preventing the disruption of barrier integrity, helping to decrease
                permeability, increasing the tightness of junctions so that bacteria can’t make their way through, and
                reducing inflammation through modulating cytokine gene expressions.</p>
            <p>Zinc can also act as an antiviral agent by preventing the replication of RNA viruses. It does this by
                inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), an enzyme that causes the replication of RNA viruses,
                like the coronavirus. Additionally, Zinc plays a role in modulating the interferon response. Interferon
                is a molecule that leads the immune response against viral infections. Zinc helps the body produce
                interferon when a virus is detected, and then dials down the immune response when the infection is
                cleared.</p>
            <p>Dr. Christopher McDevitt, of the University of Adelaide, calls Zinc “nature's antimicrobial”.</p>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>Metal-based antibacterial complexes have several advantages over conventional antibiotics, making them an
                important candidate for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Metal complexes have access to
                multiple and novel modes of action, which may prevent and/or hinder the development of antibiotic
                resistance, as bacteria must develop multiple mechanisms of resistance against the metal-based
                antibiotic.</p>
            <p>It is not far-fetched to think that metal-based antibacterial compounds could become a more prevalent
                solution in the medical treatment of bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics.</p>
            <p>The Zoilevium Topical minerals aid in the fight against persistent topical infections in the following
                way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They help with tissue formation which helps the healing process of damaged skin and open wounds.
                </li>
                <li>The powerful antimicrobial properties help in killing the infectious bacteria and thereby giving the
                    body the opportunity to heal the wound effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is therefore clear that there is abundant academic and scientific backing for the view that Zoilevium
                Topical has the characteristics and modes of action to act like a powerful broad spectrum, inorganic,
                topical metallo-antibiotic and disinfectant that can assist in combatting hard-to-treat topical/open
                wound infections.</p>

            <p>Copper is a very effective antimicrobial which employs various modes of action to kill pathogens.</p>

            <h3>Zinc</h3>
            <p>Zinc is the most influential trace mineral, as it plays a role in over 300 enzyme systems and is a key
                component in over 3000 proteins in the body – more than any other trace mineral. It is a key component
                and building block in the immune system. Zinc is also the 2nd most prevalent vestigial element in the
                human body, and it is essential for individuals to remain healthy. Studies have found that Zn(II)
                supplementation therapies have proven to be effective in reducing the incidence of respiratory
                infections. Since excess Zinc is not stored in the body, it must be consumed regularly as part of a
                healthy diet.</p>

            <p>Zinc is also known to contribute to the following:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>It contributes to normal fertility and reproduction.</li>
                <li>It helps your immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Zinc is a very effective antimicrobial which employs various modes of action to kill pathogens.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The mineral composition of Zoilevium Immune Support promotes a healthier body in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It helps the body maintain a healthy immune system. This helps the body fight off unwanted
                    pathogens, and attacks that may cause illness.</li>
                <li>It helps with various functions as discussed above which contribute to a healthier body.</li>
                <li>Because of the unique antimicrobial properties of the ingredients, many bacterial and viral
                    infections may be dealt with before they have the opportunity to incubate and start causing illness.
                </li>
                <li>Because the optimal ratio between Zinc and Copper are used in the product, these antagonistic
                    minerals are able to provide maximum efficacy.</li>
                <li>It contributes to general health and well-being.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It should therefore be clear that there is academic and scientific backing that establishes the success
                expectations of Zoilevium Immune Support’s potential contribution to a healthier body, a stronger immune
                system, and a pre-emptive defense against various attacks from pathogens.</p>
            <p>Imagine the effect on general well-being after using a mineral supplement that gives the inherent
                advantages of the associated minerals, but also acts pre-emptively on pathogens due to its powerful
                broad spectrum, inorganic, metallo-antibiotic properties.</p>
